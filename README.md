# JavaScript Array Method Mastery

This repository contains a curated set of exercises to practice and master the core functional array methods in JavaScript: `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

Each set of exercises is grouped by method and structured to encourage repetition, clarity, and long-term retention.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Modern JavaScript relies heavily on functional array methods for data transformation and logic. This repo provides:

* Real-world, interview-relevant use cases
* Clean starter templates for hands-on repetition
* Focused exercises that reinforce mental pattern recognition
* Scaffolding for advanced chaining later (e.g. `filter().map().reduce()`)

---

## 📁 Structure

```text
array-methods-practice/
├── map/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── script.js
├── filter/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── script.js
├── reduce/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── script.js
```

Each folder contains:

* `index.html` — Basic setup to run in browser
* `script.js` — Exercises with starter logic (`const variable = null`)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-array-method-mastery.git
   ```

2. Open any folder (e.g., `map/`) and open `index.html` in your browser.

3. Open the browser console to write, test, and refine your solutions.
